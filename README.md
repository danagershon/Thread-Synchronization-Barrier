# Thread Synchronization Barrier

Operating System Course HW3: Reusable Barrier Synchronization Primitive Implementation in C++

• A Reusable Barrier is a synchronization mechanism that allows N threads (N is a fixed number) to wait until all of them have reached a certain point. Once all threads have reached this certain point (the barrier), they may all continue

• A reusable barrier is a barrier that can be used more than once in the same code
